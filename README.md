# cufflinks
 
These are cufflinks I'm trying to make for my graduation, the idea is that they are tiny PCBs with onboard LEDs laid out in a circular pattern powered by a coin cell battery. The idea is to have a small PCB that can be worn on a cufflink and light up depending on sound intensity read from a onboard MEMs mic. Honestly, haven't attempted anything like this before, only hardware project before has been a simple custom key-pad. Hope this works.
